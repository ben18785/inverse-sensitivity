* Make clear that the theory isn't necessarily novel but it is new for this audience
* Lessen claims about computational burden increasing with number of outputs
* Can the output distribution always be reached?
* Change eq. 3 to the Dirac delta function
* Make explicit reference 17 to many-to-one Jacobian calculation. Also make clear that this calculation requires knowing the level sets of Q. So even if we can numerically determine the sensitivities, we are still stuck!
