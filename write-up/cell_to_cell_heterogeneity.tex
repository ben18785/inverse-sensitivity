\section{Abstract}
Variation is characteristic of all living systems. Laboratory techniques such as flow cytometry can probe individual cells and, after decades of experimentation, it is clear that even members of seemingly homogeneous cell populations can exhibit differences. To understand whether this variation is biologically meaningful, it is essential to discern its source. Mathematical models of biological systems are tools that can be used to investigate causes of cell-to-cell variation. From mathematical analysis and simulation of these models, biological hypotheses can be posed and investigated, then parameter inference can determine which of these is most compatible with experimental data. Data from laboratory experiments often takes the form of ``snapshots" representing distributions of cellular properties at different points in times, rather than individual cell trajectories. This data is not straightforward to fit using hierarchical Bayesian methods since these approaches require inferring the identities of the groups to which individual cells belong. Here, we introduce a computational sampling method we call ``Contour Monte Carlo" for estimating mathematical model parameters from snapshot distributions which is straightforward to implement and does not require assigning cells to categories \emph{a priori}. Our method is most applicable to systems where the dominant source of uncertainty is heterogeneity in cellular processes rather than experimental measurement error which, due to the increasingly fine scale resolution of laboratory techniques, may be the case for a wide class of systems. In this paper, we illustrate the use of our method by quantifying cellular variation for three biological systems of interest and provide code in the form of a Julia notebook which allows others to apply this approach to their problem.
