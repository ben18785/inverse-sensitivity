\section{Abstract}
Variation is characteristic of all living systems. Laboratory techniques such as flow cytometry can probe individual cells, and, after decades of experimentation, it is clear that even members of genetically identical cell populations can exhibit differences. To understand whether variation is biologically meaningful, it is essential to discern its source. Mathematical models of biological systems are tools that can be used to investigate causes of cell-to-cell variation. From mathematical analysis and simulation of these models, biological hypotheses can be posed and investigated, then parameter inference can determine which of these is compatible with experimental data. Data from laboratory experiments often consist of ``snapshots" representing distributions of cellular properties at different points in time, rather than individual cell trajectories. These data are not straightforward to fit using hierarchical Bayesian methods, which require the number of cell population clusters to be chosen \textit{a priori}. \textcolor{blue}{Nor are they amenable to standard nonlinear mixed effect methods, since a single observation per cell is typically too few to estimate parameter variability.} Here, we introduce a computational sampling method named ``Contour Monte Carlo" (CMC) for estimating mathematical model parameters from snapshot distributions, which is straightforward to implement and does not require cells be assigned to predefined categories. \textcolor{blue}{The CMC algorithm fits to snapshot probability distributions rather than raw data, which means its computational burden does not, like existing approaches, increase with the number of cells observed.} Our method is appropriate for \textcolor{blue}{underdetermined} systems, \textcolor{blue}{where there a fewer classes of observations than parameters to be determined, and}  where observed variation is mostly due to variability in cellular processes rather than experimental measurement error. \textcolor{blue}{This} may be the case for many systems due to continued improvements in resolution of laboratory techniques. In this paper, we apply our method to quantify cellular variation for three biological systems of interest and provide Julia code enabling others to use this method.
